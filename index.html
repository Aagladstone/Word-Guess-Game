// Watch the demo.

// Choose a theme for your game! In the demo, we picked an 80s theme: 80s questions, 80s sound and an 80s aesthetic. You can choose any subject for your theme, though, so be creative!
                    //My theme is Hiesman Hangman// //Word bank is all the Hiesman winners// //green, yellow, bronze. I want pictures and videos or audio of each one when guessed. 
// Use key events to listen for the letters that your players will type.

// Display the following on the page:

// Press any key to get started! HTML "Press any key to get started!" 

// Wins: (# of times user guessed the word correctly). "wins: varWins" number

// If the word is madonna, display it like this when the game starts: _ _ _ _ _ _ _. "Current Word: varWordBank" document.write: varWordBank 
                        //var answer = "letter"

// As the user guesses the correct letters, reveal them: m a d o _ _ a. 

// Number of Guesses Remaining: (# of guesses remaining for the user). "Number of Guesses Remaining: varGuessesRemain" number

// Letters Already Guessed: (Letters the user has guessed, displayed like L Z Y H). "Letters Already Guessed: varLettersGuessed"


//FUNCTION: takes win var and + 1, then reset letters guessed and guesses remaining. 
// After the user wins/loses the game should automatically choose another word and make the user play it. varReset if varGuessesRemain = 0 set choose another varWordBank.

//document.getElementById("button1").addEventListener("click", function(){

  //  document.getElementById("box").style.width = "350px";
